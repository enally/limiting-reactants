# Limiting-Reactants.py

 -  A simple script to determine the limiting reactant in a given reaction based on known information such as moles of reagent used and weight of reactants used.
 -  Theoretical yield of product is generated, as well as generating the amount of limiting reactant required for a chosen Theoretical yield.

## Code is still not even functional, as this is more of an exercise than a usable app
