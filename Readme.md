# Limiting-Reactants.py

 -  A simple script to determine the limiting reactant in a given reaction based on known information such as moles of reagent used and weight of reactants used.
 -  Theoretical yield of product is generated, as well as generating the amount of limiting reactant required for a chosen Theoretical yield.

## Todo List

- ~~Detect limiting reactant of equation~~
- ~~Generate theoretical yield~~
- Calculate percent yield based on actual yield
- Fix inaccurate theoretical yield with larger compounds
- Improve user interface
- Add support for multiple step reactions
